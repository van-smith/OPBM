This folder contains code used by the opbm.dll in AutoIt\common\opbm\dll\ for
the AutoIt scripts.  It holds internal functions used to assist in executing
scripts, including WaitUntilIdle() and WaitUntilSystemIdle(), along with assist
functions for snapshots of running Windows (and in the future as of the time of
this writing: Processes, Registry Keys and Files).
